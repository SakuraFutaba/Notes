## Extensions:

### Shader languages support for VS Code

support `glsl`, `hlsl` and `cg`


### ShaderlabVSCode

support `.shader` `.cginc` `.glslinc` `.hlsl` `.cg` `.compute`

At first comment shortcut `ctrl+/` cant work, it is maybe because I also installed the Unity extension and the language mode is selected as `UnityShader`. After changed to `Shaderlab`, it works.


### [Optional] Shader Toy

run [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) code on VSCode

`Ctrl+Shift+P` or right click and choose `Shader Toy: Show GLSL Preview`
